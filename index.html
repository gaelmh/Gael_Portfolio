                        <h3>Predicting Healthcare Costs</h3>
                        <p>
                            This analysis aimed to improve financial transparency in healthcare by developing a <strong>machine learning model</strong> 
                            to estimate hospital total charges. The dataset was gathered from the New York Government Health Data website. 
                            It contained over <strong>two million patient discharges</strong> from 2017 and was described by 
                            <strong>34 initial features</strong> which were refined into <strong>139 features</strong> after preprocessing.<br> 
                            
                            <br><strong>XGBoost</strong> demonstrated the best performance, achieving an <strong>R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.85</strong>, 
                            with LightGBM and Neural Network also achieving high performance. A feature importance analysis revealed 
                            that <strong>"length_of_stay"</strong> was the most influential factor. Furthermore, the project further 
                            included the utilization of an <strong>interactive Shiny web application</strong>, allowing users to input 
                            personal and medical information to receive real-time cost predictions.<br> 
                            
                            <br>This research highlights the significant value of machine learning in healthcare cost prediction, offering 
                            crucial insights for patients, insurance companies, and hospitals to optimize financial planning and decision-making 
                            processes.

                        <h3>Soccer Starting XI Prediction</h3>
                        <p>
                            This analysis aimed to predict whether a soccer player will be in the starting lineup for an upcoming game, 
                            leveraging personal characteristics, performance metrics, and team attributes. The project utilized the 
                            "Football Data from Transfermarkt" dataset, composed of <strong>10 CSV files</strong> containing <strong>543.88 MB</strong> 
                            of clubs, games, and players data in European competitions. After cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering 
                            the dataset used to train the models was reduced to approximately <strong>530,000 observations</strong> and 
                            <strong>24 features</strong>.<br>

                            <strong>precision of 97%</strong>, and <strong>recall of 91%</strong>. A feature importance analysis 
                            revealed that <strong>"minutes played"</strong> and <strong>"percentage of previous starting lineup appearances"</strong>.
                            This involved extensive use of <strong>AWS S3</strong> for data staging, <strong>AWS Athena</strong> for effective 
                            querying and data selection, and <strong>AWS EMR (Elastic MapReduce)</strong> for distributed computing, 
                            significantly accelerating data processing and model training.<br>
                            
                            <br>This research offers valuable predictive insights for coaches in the soccer industry and has real-world 
                            applications in other team sports, enhancing strategic planning and team performance.

                            This analysis aimed to accurately predict the preferred boot brand among soccer players and identify the 
                            most influential factors affecting their choice. The study utilized the "Football Boots" dataset from 
                            Kaggle, containing <strong>3,939 samples</strong> and <strong>14 features</strong> after initial 
                            preprocessing and class reduction to the three main brands (Nike, Adidas, Puma).<br>
                            
                            <br>Five machine learning models were trained, with the <strong>Decision Tree</strong> consistently 
                            performing best, achieving <strong>high accuracy</strong> and <strong>F1 score</strong> across different settings. 
                            Conversely, <strong>Ada Boosting</strong> was the weakest performer, with an <strong>accuracy of 54%</strong> and 
                            an <strong>F1 score of 41%</strong>. Feature importance analysis consistently identified 
                            <strong>"BootsTopPlayer"</strong> (indicating the most popular soccer player wearing those boots), 
                            <strong>"BootsPosition"</strong>, and qq<strong>"BootsMaterial"</strong> as the most influential factors.<br>

                        <h3>Stock Exchange System</h3>
                        <p>
                            This project involved the design and implementation of a robust, object-oriented stock exchange simulation system 
                            in Java, developed iteratively across multiple assignments. The primary aim was to create a modular and scalable 
                            platform capable of managing financial instruments, processing trades, handling user interactions, and publishing 
                            real-time market data.<br>
                            
                            <br>The system's architecture rigorously adhered to core <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles</strong>.
                            <br><strong>• Encapsulation</strong> was maintained through private data members and controlled access via public 
                            methods. 
                            <br><strong>• Polymorphism</strong> was extensively utilized through interfaces like Comparable and Tradable, 
                            enabling flexible handling of diverse financial entities such as Price objects, Orders, and Quotes. 
                            <br><strong>• Information hiding</strong> was paramount, with TradableDTO (Data Transfer Objects) used to safely 
                            convey data without exposing internal object references.<br>
                            
                            <br>Furthermore, key design patterns were strategically applied to enhance functionality and maintainability:
                            <br><strong>• Factory Pattern:</strong> A PriceFactory centralized the creation of immutable Price objects, 
                            ensuring consistency and proper formatting.
                            <br><strong>• Flyweight Pattern:</strong> The PriceFactory was further optimized to implement the Flyweight 
                            pattern, ensuring that only a single Price object exists for any given value, significantly reducing memory footprint.
                            <br><strong>• Singleton Pattern:</strong> UserManager, ProductManager, CurrentMarketTracker, and CurrentMarketPublisher 
                            were implemented as Singletons to ensure a single, globally accessible instance for managing users, products, market 
                            data tracking, and publication, respectively.
                            <br><strong>• Facade Pattern:</strong> UserManager and ProductManager acted as Facades, simplifying complex 
                            interactions with underlying user and product book management subsystems.
                            <br><strong>• Observer Pattern:</strong> A CurrentMarketObserver interface, implemented by the User class, along with 
                            CurrentMarketPublisher and CurrentMarketTracker, enabled real-time, decoupled updates of market information to 
                            subscribed users.
                            
                            <br>This project is important as it demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of designing and building complex, 
                            real-world applications using advanced OOP concepts and design patterns, crucial for developing reliable and scalable 
                            financial systems.

                        <p>
                            This study aimed to understand the relationship between <strong>demographic</strong> and <strong>lifestyle</strong> 
                            factors and their impact on medical costs. The data utilized for this analysis was the "Medical Costs Personal 
                            Dataset" from Kaggle, comprising <strong>1,338 observations</strong> across <strong>7 distinct features</strong>.<br>

                            <br><strong>Linear regression</strong> revealed that all variables significantly influenced log medical costs, 
                            with <strong>smoking</strong> having the highest effect, followed by the number of children and region. 
                            <br><strong>Logistic regression</strong> achieved <strong>90.67% accuracy</strong> in predicting whether medical costs 
                            would <strong>exceed $9,500</strong>, highlighting age and region as statistically significant predictors. 
                            <br>Finally, <strong>ANOVA</strong> demonstrated a clear and statistically <strong>significant link</strong> 
                            between <strong>smoking</strong> and <strong>higher medical expenses</strong>, with smokers incurring, on average, 
                            <strong>$23,614 more in costs</strong>.<br>
                            
                            <br>These findings offer valuable insights for healthcare practitioners, policymakers, and insurers, aiding in 
                            evidence-based decision-making for healthcare financing, resource allocation, and policy formulation, particularly 
                            regarding the financial burden of smoking.

                            dataset of NBA player statistics gathered from Kaggle. Such dataset contained information from the 1997/98 to 
                            the 2021/22 seasons, containing <strong>14573 observations</strong> and <strong>32 features</strong> before 
                            data cleaning and preprocessing.<br>
                            
                            <br>The relationship was mainly studied through the creation of <strong>data visualizations</strong>, which 
                            provided insights that include:
                            <br><strong>• Positional Influence:</strong> Point guards and shooting guards generally exhibit better free throw 
                            accuracy than centers and power forwards, suggesting a positional influence on free throw skills related to player roles.
                            <br><strong>• Attempts vs. Accuracy:</strong> Contrary to intuition, a higher number of free throw attempts showed 
                            a slight decrease in accuracy, indicating that other factors beyond sheer practice are involved.
                            <br><strong>• MVP Status:</strong> Players who have earned the MVP title are more accurate and more likely to score 
                            free throws than non-MVPs, despite the small number of MVP instances (approximately 25 MVPs in the dataset).<br>
                            
                            <br>Overall, the visualizations demonstrated the complexity of free throw accuracy, influenced by multiple factors 
                            such as fatigue, pressure, and practice. The analysis also highlighted that players who score the most points 
                            are more likely to be selected as MVPs, reinforcing the importance of scoring ability in elite player recognition.
