## About Me


## Project 1: [NBA Free Throw Accuracy Analysis](https://github.com/gaelmh/NBA-Free-Throw-Accuracy)
This is a project I did for my Data Visualizations class at DePaul University. It was completed with the aid of two other classmates.
- Techniques: Data Filtering, and Data Visualizations.
- The project write-up is published on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaelmotahernandez/details/projects/1731117327280/single-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAAD0sr1oBRU-g7rHenPy0sFhxgU6vSvExSdU).

## Project 2: [Understanding Healthcare Costs – A Generalized Approach](https://github.com/gaelmh/Understanding-Healthcare-Costs)
This is a project I did for my Generalized Linear Models class at DePaul University. It was completed with the aid of two other classmates.
- The data was taken from the “Medical Costs Personal” dataset from Kaggle.
- Techniques: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). 
- The project write-up is published on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaelmotahernandez/details/projects/1731117659564/single-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAAD0sr1oBRU-g7rHenPy0sFhxgU6vSvExSdU).

## Project 3: [Boot Brand Preference Among Soccer Player – A Machine Learning Approach](https://github.com/gaelmh/Boot-Brand-Preference)
This is a project I did for my Machine Learning class at DePaul University.
- The data was taken from the “Football Boots” dataset from Kaggle.
- Techniques: Class Balancing (Random Oversampling, Random Undersampling, and SMOTE), Feature Selection (Wrapper-based and Univariate), and Machine Learning Modeling (Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Ada Boosting, and Neural Networks).
- The project write-up is published on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaelmotahernandez/details/projects/1731117948171/single-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAAD0sr1oBRU-g7rHenPy0sFhxgU6vSvExSdU).
